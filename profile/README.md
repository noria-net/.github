# The Noria Network

Noria is a decentralized financial network focused on accessibility, practicality, and ease-of-use.

Noria strives to have the same practical usability as an Apple product. Noria will be the first crypto network that uses a stable denomination, the Denom. Instead of collecting fees in its volatile network token as other networks do, Noria will collect fees exclusively with a stable currency, encouraging protocols, asset pairs, and liquidity providers to standardize around the Denom as a universal form of money across the network. Noria will also have a strong focus on real world usage, prioritizing funding towards applications that have practical utility like digital payments / retailing, remittances / transfers, and mobile app financial integrations.
